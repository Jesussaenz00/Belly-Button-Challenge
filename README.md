The task involves creating an interactive data visualization dashboard using the D3 library. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

Load Data: Use D3 to load samples.json from a URL.
Bar Chart: Display the top 10 OTUs with sample_values for values, otu_ids for labels, and otu_labels for hover text.
Bubble Chart: Plot samples with otu_ids for x, sample_values for y and bubble size, and otu_labels for text.
Metadata: Show the demographic info of the selected sample in a panel.
Interactivity: Update charts when a new sample is selected via a dropdown.
